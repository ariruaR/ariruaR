# **Hi! My name is Ruslan and I'm Python Software Developer**

## ***About Me:***
I am an 18-year-old developer specialising in web application development in Python using Flask and FastApi.
In addition, I gained professional experience working in a startup for half a year. In this role, I contributed to the development and maintenance of a Telegram bot. For a period of approximately three months, I provided personalised instruction on the creation of Flask applications from the ground up.
My primary specialism is backend development, encompassing work with MySQl, SQLite, and PostgreSQL. I have experience with React and am currently teaching various disciplines at TOP Academy.
